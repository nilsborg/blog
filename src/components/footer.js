    <p>Hi there, my name is Nils BorgbÃ¶hmer.</p>
    <p>
      You found the blog I always wanted to have, where I write about stuff that
      I like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably alot of this will be about living the designer and web developer
      freelance life, which always throws up some hurdles to blog about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also I'm a proud dad and might chuck a couple very wise comments your way
      about that too{' '}
