So since I've been using Gitlab.com for a while now, I actually started dreaming of running my own Gitlab server.
The hosted version is cool and all but I wanted control over where my data goes and also – I have to say – Gitlab.com tends to be down sometimes, which kinda bumms me out.

It's a brilliant free service of course – but I installed my own Gitlab anyway. And I'm actually also only writing this post now because I need something to test my very first very own Gitlab Runner! :D:D

(Time's a bit scarce atm – hope to be blogging more again soon!)
