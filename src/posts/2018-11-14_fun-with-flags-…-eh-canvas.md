So, this post is going to be one of so many Love Songs to Mister [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/). Wes apparently decided at some point of his existence as a brilliant web developer to make a living from sharing his wisdom. And I'm very happy he did!

Just recently a buddy of mine and myself wanted to get started with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and try that out as a static site generator instead of my long friend [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (The outcome of that story is gonna be another post but it's going to be another love song, I can tell you that much already üòÅ).

**Quick version**: Gatsby is based on React and I did not have the slightest clue about React!

I remebered the time when I wanted to get rid of jQuery in my life because it felt old and clunky. At that time I stumbled over Wes' [ES6 for Everyone Course](https://es6.io/), took that and was very happy with my new knowledge and my jQuery-free life!

Gladly, Wes did another brilliant Course called "[React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/)". And just as with the ES6 Course, I crawled through that Course in a couple days and came out the other end with a solid understanding of React and therefore Gatsby too!

AND NOW ‚Ä¶ haha this will end soon I promise! ‚Äì I wanted to share a piece of Javascript knowledge I aquired today in just 17 minutes from Wes' free Course: [Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/).

I never worked with `<canvas>` before and was very surprised how easy this fun thing was to create!

Take 15 minutes out of your schedule every day and take this course ‚Äì¬†I promise it's fun and you'll learn something you did not know about Javascript.
